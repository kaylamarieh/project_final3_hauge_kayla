## Resources
* [jQuery Download](https://jquery.com/download/)
    * I used this site to download the jQuery file used throughout my project.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    * I used this to download font awesome and use the icons available there. You can see the icon under the navigation on all the pages for smaller screen sizes.
* [jQuery API Documentation](https://api.jquery.com/empty/)
    * I used this to read about a way to remove child elements from the dom. I used .empty() in order to remove the child elements and then add a different element when clicking on the various icons seen under the navigation on the smaller screen sizes.
* [Parallax](http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/)
    * This is the jQuery plugin used on my site. It can be seen on the "In Bloom" page on the website. What it does is created an overlap of background images which when scrolling replace each other as the background.
* [Box Loader](https://github.com/matiasdg/boxLoader-Jquery-Plugin)
    * This is another jQuery plugin used on the site. It can be seen on the "Send Flowers," "Get Flowers," and "Workshops" pages on the website. What it does is load content as the the site is scrolled.
* [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/unicorn/#validate-by-uri+task_conformance)
    * I used this to validate my code and check for any errors.
* [HTML5 Outliner](https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/)
    * I used this to outline my code and make sure that no portions were left undefined.
